# lattica - refactor/deprecated-sol-contracts

## NOTE:

Early on, protocol switched from writing the smart contracts in solidity to using vyper and its tooling, following in Curve's footsteps. This branch contains the deprecated and abandoned solidity smart contracts (mostly interfaces) that we had only just begun implementing and testing (Sites).

The code in this branch **DOES NOT WORK**: its unfinished, is definitely not safe, and not gas efficient/optimized. Use anything at your own risk.
